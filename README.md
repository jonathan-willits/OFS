Authors: Osayame Erinmwingbovo, Annie Luu, Charlie Nguyen, Jonathan Willits
## About

This project is a grocery delivery service website for a San Jose-based grocery store chain. The site serves as a way 
for grocery store customers to purchase organic food online (e.g. fruits, vegetables, and other grocery items) into a 
virtual shopping cart, pay for it online and have it delivered to their home. The site stores inventory, transaction, 
customer data in MySQL, and includes an employee/admin dashboard view to update/query the inventory and transaction 
database.
